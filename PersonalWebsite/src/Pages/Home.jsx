                        After being being given recommendation by a friend, I became a member of the Gaming and Emerging Technology club, which exposed me to the fascinating world of game development. Through the club, I met exceptionally skilled individuals who encouraged me to explore game engines such as Godot and Unity. This led me to participate in numerous game jams, where I joined teams to create games within a week. I take immense pride in our collective achievements, as we emerged victorious in many of these endeavors.
